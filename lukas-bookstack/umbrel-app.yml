releaseNotes: >-
    BookStack v24.05.4 has been released.

    This is a security release to address issues found in LDAP group syncing, where in certain scenarios a user could be matched to extra roles incorrectly, and an issue with content visibility in "book-show" API responses which would not have permissions applied properly.

    Upgrade is strongly advised for instances where LDAP authentication is used with group syncing, or where the REST API is used to fetch contents of books ("books-read" endpoint).

    Thanks to Linus Nagel and their team at WorkSimple GmbH for reporting this API vulnerability.
